# various_latex
I am putting some old latex files here.
The files are meaningless in some cases (For example one talks about a 3rd charge after Positive and Negative.)

**WARNING** Many of the TeX files won't compile in case of your computer because of lack of additional files and packages. They need to be edited to be compiled.
