\textbf{The Hidden Properties of the $3^{rd}$ charge Particles}
\\
There is an mysterious \emph{Quantum Mechanical} model that tells that there should be some \emph{Third kind of Charge}, different than the \emph{positive} and the \emph{negative} charges that we are familiar with. This assumption of a third charge can change almost everything on Physics that we currently know, but let this mere Hypothesis find out the properties that would come out if we assume such an entity is there. Can it really break all the Physics that we've been studying so far?

\parbox{\textwidth}{%
{\textbf{T1:} This charge has some symmetry lessness. Derive the \textbf{Schrodinger's Equation} for such a charge.Now this shouldn't bother you because the derivation doesn't requires how the charge should be around a positive or a negative charge, so doesn't necessarily need to build up an atom with this exotic thing.
